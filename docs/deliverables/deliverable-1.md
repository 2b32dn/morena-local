Project Deliverable 1
The Project Overview provides a foundational summary of the project, outlining its purpose, objectives, members roles, timeline and current progress. Below is a guideline for elaborating your team’s Project Overview.




Client Search and Potential Clients:

- Describe the team’s efforts to find a potential client for the project:

Client 1)
We have reached out to Dickson’s friend who is a designer. She is one of the main organizers for the collective Double Entendre. It is a group exhibition between Montreal and Toronto emerging designers. The central theme of the exhibition is to challenge how design principles can be applied to give intentions to unexpected and unconventional elements, not commonly associated with design. Instead of merely accepting imperfections or byproducts as flaws, they seek to harness those potential features into their creative process. Double Entendre is a potential client because they simply have an Instagram page as the main social platform. Creating a website for them will provide greater exposure and hence, greater recognition. But sadly, she said no because she doesn’t have a vision of how the website should be and it is too much work. 



Client 2)
Another potential client is another friend of Dickson. He is a deacon at a church and is currently the one maintaining the website. They might want a revamp of their website and include some new features. So far, no answer has been provided yet. 

Client 3)
Another potential client is my brother-in-law (Thuson). I contacted him last week, still waiting for a response. He owns a supermarket. 

Other methods)
We also tried posting on social media looking for leads, but it was not successful.
