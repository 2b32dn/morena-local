Project Deliverable 2

Business Summary and User Stories:

1. Business Summary
1.1 Business Overview
The client operates a family-owned Filipino restaurant called Morena that offers dine-in and takeout options. Their menu includes traditional Filipino meals like Sisig, Lechon Kawali and desserts such as Halo-Halo. The restaurant is busiest on weekends and receives regular customers from the local neighborhood. 
1.2 Core Activities
Orders are placed directly at the restaurant or are taken by phone. Marketing is handled through word of mouth within the client’s local community and church. The client also deploys and advertises its menu through UberEats.
1.3 Current Tools & Technologies
The owner currently relies on limited digital tools and technologies. He has a Facebook page, but it has not been updated recently. He does not use any other social media platforms for advertising or customer engagement. Additionally, the restaurant is listed on UberEats, which provides some online visibility and access to delivery customers.

1.4 Challenges or Inefficiencies
The client faces several challenges and inefficiencies in their current operations. They are reluctant to implement an online reservation system, expressing concerns that some customers book tables at the last minute and do not respect scheduled times, leading to unnecessary chaos. Additionally, managing takeout orders and reservations during peak hours is a stressful and error-prone process.
1.5 Opportunities for Improvement
An online system with menu management would reduce manual work and improve customer convenience. One of the website’s purposes is to outreach a broader audience and increase the client’s customer base by promoting Filipino cuisine. 
1.6 Stakeholders
The key stakeholders are the restaurant owner and the customers.
1.7 Technical Constraints or Needs
The owner wants a very simple backend dashboard, one that can primarily accommodate his mobile device but which should also be scalable.
