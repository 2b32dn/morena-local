Team D: write down 5 user stories for the following photographer’s website As a professional photographer, I need a system to handle event bookings, keep track of client details, schedules, and make payments easy. Clients should be able to book online, get confirmations, and receive reminders for their sessions. For selling my artistic pictures on my website, I need an online store where people can browse, buy, and download images or order prints. It should also help me manage limited editions and handle secure payments. I’d also like tools to organize and showcase my portfolio, track sales and bookings, and keep things running smoothly. A simple dashboard to update galleries, manage orders, and communicate with clients would make a big difference.

1) Booking System
As a client, I want to book a photography session online by selecting a date, time, and package, so that I can easily schedule my session without needing to call or email.

2) Event and Client Management
As a photographer, I want to view and manage all upcoming bookings, client details, and session schedules through a central dashboard, so that I can stay organized and prepare for each event efficiently.

3) Online Store for Art Prints
As a visitor, I want to browse an online gallery, purchase digital downloads or order physical prints, so that I can buy the artwork I love securely and conveniently.

4) Payment and Confirmation Automation
As a client, I want to receive automatic payment confirmations, booking confirmations, and session reminders, so that I feel reassured that everything is on track without extra effort.

5) Portfolio and Sales Tracking
As a photographer, I want an easy-to-use dashboard where I can upload new portfolio images, track print sales, and monitor booking stats, so that I can update my site quickly and understand how my business is performing.


Team F: write down 5 user stories for the following sugar shack website For my family’s sugar shack, I need a system to handle reservations for both regular visitors and events. Customers should be able to easily book tours, tastings, or special events online and get reminders about their visits. I also need the system to manage larger group bookings for things like school trips or corporate events, making sure the schedule doesn’t get mixed up. It should help me keep track of visitor numbers, special requests, and dietary needs. It would be great if I could update pricing, offer special deals, and process payments securely. A simple dashboard to manage all reservations, events, and customer questions would make everything easier to keep track of.

1) Reservation for Regular Visits
As a client, I want to easily book a tour, tasting, or regular visit online, without needing to call or email.

2) Visitor and Special Requests
As an owner, I want to track visitor numbers, special requests, and dietary needs per booking, so that I can prepare in advance for each group.

3) Notification Reminders
As a client, I want to receive reminders about my upcoming booking via email or SMS.

4) Special deals
As an owner, I want to send emails with special deals depending on their visiting history ( newcomer, seasonal or VIP).

5) Admin Dashboard
As an owner, I want to visualize where my customers are spending their dollars on such as entertainment services, food kiosks, mini-train rides and what-not. Knowing where they are spending their money, I can invest in creating a better user experience.
