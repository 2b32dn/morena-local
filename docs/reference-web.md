When you land on the website, you’ll be able to choose your preferred language right away. We could also include a Bible verse here to reflect the heart of the restaurant. Some smooth transitions would make the page feel more inviting, and the font adds a nice vibe—it really fits the place, especially with the good music they always have playing. 


We could also include the restaurant’s locations and add an ‘Order Online’ button that links to their UberEats page. We can also give users the option to place an order by phone (button)
